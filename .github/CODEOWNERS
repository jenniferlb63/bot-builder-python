# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.

# Bot Framework SDK notes:
# The first code owners for a file or library are the primary approvers.
# The later code owners represent a "escalation path" in case the primary code owners are unavailable.
# - @microsoft/bb-python will also never receive a request for a PR review and should be manually requested
#   for PRs that only trigger the Global rule ("*")
# - @microsoft/bf-admin should never receive a request for a PR review

# Global rule:
* @microsoft/bb-python @microsoft/bf-admin
